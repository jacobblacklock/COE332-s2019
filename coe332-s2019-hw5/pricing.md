PRICING SCHEME

To access the API and data initially, an account must be created that incurs a base charge of $5 a month, which includes 200 queries. After this, additionally queries will be charged at 10 cents per record in the query. If a user posts a contribution to the data, they will be given record credit per record posted. For example, if a user had 3 record credits, then they would not be charged for the first 3 records queried after their initial 200.
